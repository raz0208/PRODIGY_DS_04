### Key Features:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing sentiment distribution across topics
- Analyzing message length distribution by sentiment
- Insights from Twitter data related to tech brands like Google and Microsoft

## Dataset

The dataset is an entity-level sentiment analysis dataset from Twitter, containing the following columns:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for each tweet
- **Topic**: The subject or entity discussed in the tweet
- **Sentiment**: The sentiment of the tweet towards the topic (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Irrelevant)

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values**: Handled missing values by removing rows with null entries.
- **Duplicates**: Removed duplicate entries from the dataset.
  
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Sentiment Distribution**: Visualized sentiment counts using bar plots and pie charts to understand the overall distribution of sentiments across the dataset.
- **Topic-wise Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzed how different topics are perceived by plotting topic-wise sentiment distributions.
- **Message Length Analysis**: Investigated the relationship between message length and sentiment using histograms and boxplots.
- **Heatmap**: Created a heatmap to show the distribution of sentiments across various topics.

### 3. Sentiment Visualizations
- **Sentiment Distribution**: Pie charts and bar plots show the prevalence of each sentiment class.
- **Top 5 Topics**: Visualized sentiments for the top 5 most discussed topics in the dataset.
- **Sentiment Distribution by Topic**: Created bar plots to show positive, negative, neutral, and irrelevant sentiments for popular topics like **Google** and **Microsoft**.

### 4. WordCloud Visualizations
